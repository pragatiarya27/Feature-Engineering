# Feature-Engineering
Understood ML basics – You learned definitions of parameters, correlation, negative correlation, machine learning, optimizers, and sklearn modules.

Explored data types – You understood continuous and categorical variables and how to encode them using Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Ordinal Encoding.

Learned dataset preparation – You practiced splitting data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

Performed preprocessing – You used StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to scale numerical data.

Explored ML workflow – You understood model fitting (model.fit()), prediction (model.predict()), feature scaling, and the importance of EDA.

Worked with correlation – You learned what correlation means, how negative correlation works, and how to calculate it using df.corr() and heatmaps in Python.

Troubleshooting code errors – You corrected NameError issues such as undefined variables (X and df) and learned how to properly define and load datasets before preprocessing.
